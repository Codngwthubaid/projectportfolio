                    Semantic Elements are paramount because they make our code easy to read, accessible, and equally
                    lead to
                    a more consistent code; hence we should use Semantic Elements so that screen readers can easily
                    interpret our web pages. Furthermore, the semantic HTML5 element entails describing our code in a
                    human
                    and machine-readable way to make it look nicer. Therefore, to have a better user experience, you
                    need to
                    use the Semantic HTML5 element to get the best experience.

                    HTML was initially created as a markup language to describe documents, but as the internet grew,
                    people
                    wanted to make the web look nicer; hence people started to use “non-semantic” tags like div and
                    span,
                    but as a programmer, you need Semantic Elements to be able to write clean code in a manner that it
                    can
                    describe its meaning to both the Browser and the Developer. In this article, we’ll describe the
                    available semantic HTML elements and explain their advantages.

                <div id="section-third-article-first-div1">
                    “Semantics” as a word relates to meanings, to studying meaning in language, and it also means the
                    study
                    of the meanings of words and sentences. We think of semantics as the magic that usually occurs when
                    people communicate and understand each other fluently. Semantics simply means “Meaning”.

                <div id="section-third-article-first-div2">
                    Semantic Elements are those elements that have some meaning. In programming, the word “Semantics”
                    have
                    to do with the meaning of the code. Semantic HTML elements have to do with the syntax that makes the
                    HTML very easy to understand, thereby introducing good sense to the web pages rather than just
                    presentations. Semantic Elements naturally represent their meaning to both the Developer and the
                    Browser
                    to the extent that it makes it easy for screen readers used by those with impaired vision to
                    understand
                    the code easily.

                Semantics elements make it easy for developers and screen readers to

                the code.

                <strong> 3. Cleaner Code:</strong>
                Semantic Elements make our code cleaner and make more sense where each element uses the
                appropriate word.

                We should use Semantic HTML Elements because it makes our code much easier to read, and even a
                non-specialist can easily read and understand the code. Likewise, your code will be readily understood
                as a programmer if you use Semantic HTML Elements. Finally, using Semantic Elements will make it easy
                for more people to understand your code, especially for screen readers with a sight impairment.

                        in an article element, probably with one or more section elements within.

            As a 21st-century programmer, you must use the Semantic HTML5 elements to make your code meaningful,
            accessible, readable, organized, consistent, and perfect. Thanks a lot for reaching the end of my
            article on “The reasons why you should use Semantic HTML5 Elements”.
